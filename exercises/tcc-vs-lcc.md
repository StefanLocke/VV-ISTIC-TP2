# TCC *vs* LCC

Explain under which circumstances *Tight Class Cohesion* (TCC) and *Loose Class Cohesion* (LCC) metrics produce the same value for a given Java class. Build an example of such as class and include the code below or find one example in an open-source project from Github and include the link to the class below. Could LCC be lower than TCC for any given class? Explain.

## Answer

For TCC and LCC to produce the same value, no indirect connections have to be present in the lcc class, if the indirect connection count is 0, the rest of the formula is identical
